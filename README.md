## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **complete Machine Learning & NLP pipeline** for **spam email classification**.
It covers all stages of a real-world ML workflow — from **raw text preprocessing** to **model evaluation, comparison, and selection**.

The main objective is to **compare multiple classification algorithms** and determine the **best-performing model** using industry-standard metrics.

---

## 🧠 Models Implemented

The following classification models are trained and evaluated:

* 🟢 **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**
* 🔵 **Logistic Regression** *(with GridSearchCV)*
* 🟠 **Decision Tree Classifier** *(with GridSearchCV)*
* 🔴 **Random Forest Classifier** *(with GridSearchCV)*

---

## 📂 Dataset Requirements

The dataset must be provided as a **CSV file** with:

* **Text column** (e.g. `message`, `text`, `email`)
* **Label column** (e.g. `spam`, `label`, `category`)

### ✅ Supported Label Formats

| Format  | Example      |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Text    | `ham / spam` |
| Integer | `0 / 1`      |
| String  | `"0" / "1"`  |

### 📄 Example Dataset

```csv
message,spam
"Congratulations! You won a prize",1
"Meeting tomorrow at 10am",0
```

## 🔡 Feature Extraction

Two vectorization techniques are applied:

| Model               | Vectorization                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Naive Bayes         | **Bag of Words (CountVectorizer)** |
| Logistic Regression | **TF-IDF**                         |
| Decision Tree       | **TF-IDF**                         |
| Random Forest       | **TF-IDF**                         |
